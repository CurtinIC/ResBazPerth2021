  title: "Keystory - Applying data science to health care"
  description: "Can we predict how many emergency admissions would occur in the next hour? Or is it possible to provide better care by automating cumbersome but essential clinical tasks? Discover how data science can help shape the 'health and care', in an industry which has data locked into many disparate systems. In this talk, we will touch upon 'the data and digital skills' required to overcome some of the challenges in realising the real value of healthcare data."

  title: "Tidy data and introduction to OpenRefine"
  description: "This is a 'Bring your own device' session. Good data organisation is the foundation of any research project. We often organise data in spreadsheets in ways that we as humans want to work with it, but computers require data be organised in particular ways. In order to use tools that make computation more efficient such as programming languages like R or Python, we need to structure our data the way that computers need it. Since this is where most research projects start, this is where we want to start too!<br /><br /> 

  Preparing data for analysis is an important part of the research workflow. Some of this involves data cleaning, where errors in the data are identifed and corrected or formatting made consistent. OpenRefine is a powerful free and open source tool for working with messy data: cleaning it and transforming it from one format into another. This lesson will teach you to use OpenRefine to effectively clean and format data and automatically track any changes that you make. Many people comment that this tool saves them literally months of work trying to make these edits by hand."
