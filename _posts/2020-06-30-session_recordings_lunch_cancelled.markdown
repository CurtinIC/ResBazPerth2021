With Perth's 4 day (hopefully) lockdown currently in place, we unfortunately have had to cancel the Celebration Lunch scheduled on Friday- registrants should have received an email.

We hope you are all staying safe and well, and are enjoying the virtual sessions!

Links to session recordings are being updated on [the SESSIONS page](/ResBazPerth2021/sessions/) as they become available.

Look for the recording links on the session of interest, but please note that recordings are not available for all sessions.

Thanks!
