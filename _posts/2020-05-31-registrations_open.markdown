More registrations have opened!

We have a great list of presentations scheduled on [the SCHEDULE page](/ResBazPerth2021/schedule/) - Registrations have now opened for sessions on Julia, Data analysis and visualisation with R and python, and using the Nimbus Research Cloud, plus many more! 

Registrations for more sessions are still to come, so be sure to check back there regularly for updates!

Thanks!
