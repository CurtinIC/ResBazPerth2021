ResBaz Perth 2021 commences tomorrow! Many of our workshops and presentations will be delivered using the Webex teleconferencing platform.

If you have any issues connecting to Webex, try some of these tips below:

* You may be prompted to download the Webex client, available [here](https://www.webex.com/downloads.html)
* Video Conferencing - [Join a Webex Meeting](https://help.webex.com/en-us/nrbgeodb/Join-a-Webex-Meeting)
* [Troubleshooting including issues with starting/joining](https://help.webex.com/en-us/WBX9000018881/Troubleshooting-Webex-Meetings)
* While watching a presentation – if the image is a little small for you to read easily, you can zoom in on the presentation – move your mouse/hover over the left hand side of the screen and use the zoom in/zoom out buttons, or swap to ‘full screen’ to adjust your view.


Thanks!
