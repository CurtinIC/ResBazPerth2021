Here's a list of the talks we have confirmed so far, many more to come!

#### Machine Learning

* How to automate your grant applications
* Optimal parameters for the most effecient friends

If you belong to one of those groups you are cordially invited to submit a talk proposal (or a number of proposals). An independent program committee assesses the proposals and selects the actual conference talks.<br/>

#### DevOps

* Nested Jenkins servers, and why you need them

#### Any questions?
